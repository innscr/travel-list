## General Information
The project was created for scientific purposes based on [[course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course)]. The application allows the user to add items to the "packing" list by entering the item description and select the quantity. The user can control the added items by removing them from the list by clicking on the red X button or mark the selected items as "packed" using checkbox. Displayed list of items, can be sorted by order of entry, description or status of packaging. It is also possible to clear the whole list of items by using the "CLEAR LIST" button. To prevent accidental deletion of the list contents, a message is displayed confirming the operation.
